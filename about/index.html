                <p>A response to a world that centers on manufacturing, constantly on the move, chasing economic efficiency, where we are
                conscious that we no longer understand the backstage workings of the products we consume. The silent socioeconomic
                boundaries drawn through consumption of luxury goods and the overall knockoff effect, allows the product to reach
                populations that generally can’t afford the original. The costs to the rightful owner are intangible, the pirates have
                taken something you own, they have reproduced it, so you don’t suffer a loss but rather a lesser gain. This is not
                simply an alteration project nor does it propose design solutions to solve critical issues. Rather, it re-imagines
                fashion as a common ground of non-discrimination and inclusion, combining both formal and conceptual aspects of power
                relations within the fashion system. Evolution of luxury taken into a democratized play field by a decided minority.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Most of us assume, correctly, that the majority of our goods are made in factories in the Far East, probably situated in the Pearl River Delta of Southern China. The current state of globalization is building momentum to challenge the linear take-make-waste model and take holistic approaches to creation and consumption. By creating projects that shed light to the inequalities of colonized relationships in fashion and the asymmetries of power, I have found that there are ways to be proactive in making what’s “empowering” more present and the “harmful” distant, through sustainable thinking practices that focus on user-centered design and justice. Without global equity and justice, we will not have a global fashion system that works for everyone</p>
