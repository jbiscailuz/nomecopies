                <p>A response to a world that centers on manufacturing, constantly on the move, chasing economic efficiency, where we are
                conscious that we no longer understand the backstage workings of the products we consume. The silent socioeconomic
                boundaries drawn through consumption of luxury goods and the overall knockoff effect, allows the product to reach
                populations that generally can’t afford the original. The costs to the rightful owner are intangible, the pirates have
                taken something you own, they have reproduced it, so you don’t suffer a loss but rather a lesser gain. This is not
                simply an alteration project nor does it propose design solutions to solve critical issues. Rather, it re-imagines
                fashion as a common ground of non-discrimination and inclusion, combining both formal and conceptual aspects of power
                relations within the fashion system. Evolution of luxury taken into a democratized play field by a decided minority.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The globalization of commerce and the transport of texts, images, symbols, objects, and products across national
                boundaries and cultural spaces calls into question the ownership of such things, but when original and copy begin to
                overlap to the extent that they do today (and the struggle to maintain the distinction between these two things,
                “original” and “copy,” is precisely what constitutes the crisis, to my mind). What do we mean when we say “copy”?</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Adaptability constitutes a path that allows multiple users to participate. This was expllored by implementing stretch
                fabrics as a medium to conceptualize inclusion. A tailored suit that fits everybody.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The Chanel Sling-back and Nike AF-1 are two pillars of style that usually stand on opposite sides. The ChanAirforce-X
                bridges this gap and evolves to hold multiple users and intersectionalities.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Disposable luxury includes objects that are a courtesy to the user. Authentic products from luxury brands for free. The
                demand you get at the price of zero is many times higher than the one you get at a low price, taking money out of the
                equation, can greatly increase participation.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Through the appropriation of the language used in knockoff markets, where hybrids are created with multiple brands (
                that would usually compete against each other), the intent is to eliminate competition as they cohabit in one same
                piece. The creation of these pieces was achieved thanks to donations of users that disposed of these original products (
                such as garment bags, dust bags and paper bags). These users , as well as intermediaries, brands will all be recognized
                for their collaboration in the creation of these pieces.</p>
                <p>Most of us assume, correctly, that the majority of our goods are made in factories in the Far East, probably situated in the Pearl River Delta of Southern China. The current state of globalization is building momentum to challenge the linear take-make-waste model and take holistic approaches to creation and consumption. By creating projects that shed light to the inequalities of colonized relationships in fashion and the asymmetries of power, I have found that there are ways to be proactive in making what’s “empowering” more present and the “harmful” distant, through sustainable thinking practices that focus on user-centered design and justice. Without global equity and justice, we will not have a global fashion system that works for everyone</p>
